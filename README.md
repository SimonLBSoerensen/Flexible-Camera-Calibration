# Installation
- Recommended: Install flexiblecc from PyPI: 
```sh
pip install flexiblecc
```
- Alternatively: install flexiblecc from the GitHub source:

First, clone flexiblecc using `git`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SimonLBSoerensen/Flexible-Camera-Calibration
```

Then, `cd` to the folder and run the install command:
```sh
cd Flexible-Camera-Calibration
